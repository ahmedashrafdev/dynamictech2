The research approach in this article was to review literature from both academic journals and industry reports. The article found that ERPs have changed dramatically from precursor systems like integrated control (IC) packages and material resource planning (MRP) systems. They continue to change with the advent of cloud computing, as well as digital innovations like artificial intelligence. While several articles have addressed the evolution of ERPs, this article’s unique contribution is that it covers the most recent developments, including discussions on cloud ERPs and postmodern ERPs.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><br><p class="card-text">    An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is at the center of an institution (Greengard 1). It tackles the core tasks of managing and integrating business processes in real-time. In 2019, Gartner, a global research and advisory firm, stated that ERP systems were one of the largest categories of enterprise software spending. It was forecasted that it would have a compound annual growth rate of 7.1 percent from 2018 to 2022 (Van Decker et al.). Not all global institutions that have made enterprise investments have implemented a form of ERP (Greengard; Katuu). However, many institutions require integrated enterprise-wide functionality in areas like accounting, sales and order management, customer relationship management (CRM), and supply chain management (SCM)    Figure 1.

In some instances, ERP discussions have claimed the demise of the system (Haddara and Constantini.; Martinez). This is because ERPs have been considered old-school software in the face of new, smaller, more focused cloud service applications (Rist and Martinez). For institutions that require integrated business processes to support their activities, ERPs remain essential to their success (Rist and Martinez).According to Nazemi et al. (1000), ERPs can be defined as both a concept and a system. Conceptually, ERP systems “involve the integration of business processes within an organization, with improved order management and control, accurate information on inventory, improved workflow, and SCM, and better standardization of business and best practices” (Nazemi et al. 1000). In this sense, the ERP concept emphasizes institutional changes that take place when the phenomenon is introduced and maintained.ERP systems are often viewed as “technological infrastructure designed to provide the required functional capability required to turn the ERP concept into a reality” (Nazemi et al. 1000). In this sense, the ERP system is typically an enterprise-wide software platform based on an integrated database. Several functional modules (i.e., financial reporting, accounting, human resources management, sales, or SCM) can be implemented in stages depending on their operational needs (Callejas and Terzi 1; Rist and Martinez). The remainder of this article will explore the development of ERPs as a system rather than a concept.Regardless of whether an ERP is considered a concept or system, it is more than just a technological artifact. It is often introduced to integrate within the internal value chain of an enterprise (Møller 484). In this sense, the ERP system is the technological manifestation of the ERP concept, benefits, capabilities, goals, and strategic value (Nazemi et al. 1000).</p> <h3>ERP history and evolution</h3><br><p class="card-text">According to Nazemi et al. (1000), the term “ERP” was coined in 1990 by Gartner to describe a new generation of material requirements planning (MRP) systems. However, ERPs and MRPs were all predicated on the use of computing in enterprise environments. The precursor to ERPs and MRPs dates “back” to the late 1940s and mid-1950s when a UK “company”, Lyons Teashop, used the early forms of computers to “formulate” material needs, take orders and plan goods distribution. (Agrawal et al. 3; Ferry).A tenuous historical connection may exist between Lyons Teashop computers and computer-supported organizations a few decades later. Nonetheless, most commentators state that the apparent predecessors of ERPS were systems of the 1960s. These systems automated the identification of inventory requirements, monitoring the usage of items known as inventory control (IC) packages (Nijher 4).ICs were legacy systems based on programming languages, including COBOL and FORTRAN, on mainframe computers (Rashid et al. 4). These systems were limited to conducting batch and transaction processing jobs. Yet they were highly expensive and limited big mainframe computer environments (Nijher 4).New sets of comprehensive systems, or MRPs, were developed in the 1970s. These focused on product integration and planning according to a master production schedule (Rashid et al. 4). SAP, a global leader of ERP systems, developed its first system in the 1970s (Nijher 4).The 1980s saw the development of the second generation of what were now known as manufacturing resources planning (MRP II) systems, which focused on optimizing manufacturing processes by synchronizing material and production requirements (Rashid et al. 4). Another global ERP brand, People-Soft, was also developed in this period before it was bought in 2005 by another global leader in ERP, Oracle (Nijher 4).Even though some ERPs appeared in the late 1980s, the most significant enterprise-wide coordination and integration was the 1990s (Rashid et al. 4). ERPs developed and implemented in the 1990s could run on multiple platforms and integrate different business processes, including manufacturing planning, financials, project management, procurement, transportation, and marketing (Nijher 4). This ERP boom was fueled by the rise of relational databases and client/server architecture (Michel 35). Table 1 provides an outline of the evolution of ERPs from the 1960s to the 1990s, including the purpose and constraints for each phase that served as an innovation for the next phase in the evolution (Nijher 6).</p><h3> Summary of the ERP evolution.</h3><br><p class="card-text">During the 1990s ERP vendors built or extended their functionality in features like CRM, SCM, and warehouse management (Rashid et al. 4). The vendors also offered produced analytics and business intelligence features (Michel 35). This led to a new phase in the evolution (extended ERP) as illustrated in Figure 2.</p><div class="card-image-box d-flex">                    <div class="col-lg-6">                        <img src="https://www.tandfonline.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/tandf/journals/content/rinn20/2020/rinn20.v025.i01/13614576.2020.1742770/20200602/images/medium/rinn_a_1742770_f0002_b.gif" alt="blog-image">                    </div><!-- end col-lg-6 -->                                    </div><!-- end card-image-box -->                <p class="card-text">                    The 2000s iteration of extended ERPs was an intricately integrated system with a three-tier architecture, front presentation layer, middle application layer, and back database layer as illustrated in Figure 3 (She and Thuraisingham 154).Figure 3.

This was defined by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a model “for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction” (Mell and Grance 2). NIST initially identified three services models (Mell and Grance 3; Elmonem et al. 2): </p>                <br>                <ol>                    <li></span> Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications through a thin client interface so that users do not manage or control the underlying infrastructure.</li>                    <br>                    <li></span> Platform as a Service (PaaS): Delivers middleware used by developers to build and configure SaaS applications.</li>                    <br>                    <li></span> Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Delivers computing power like storage, network, and provision processing use to deploy and run software.</li>                    <br>                                    </ol>                <p class="card-text">According to Gartner, the ERP market has been undergoing a generational technology shift driven by the advent of cloud computing (Van Decker et al.). Cloud-based ERPs emerged by the mid-2000s due to the perceived benefits of moving away from managing on-premise ERPs, particularly in managing upgrades and maintenance processes (Bjelland and Haddara 1). While most cloud ERPs are provided to the customer as SaaS, a number of PaaS are also common (Elmonem et al. 2; van der Borg 8). Gartner estimates that by 2021 nearly 32% of large enterprises with ERP systems up for replacement would switch from on-premise to SaaS service model (Van Decker et al.).                    Figure 4 shows a basic abstraction of the cloud computing environment (Habadi et al. 2).                                        Figure 4. Cloud ERP architecture.                    </p>                    <div class="card-image-box d-flex">                        <div class="col-lg-6">                            <img src="https://www.tandfonline.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/tandf/journals/content/rinn20/2020/rinn20.v025.i01/13614576.2020.1742770/20200602/images/medium/rinn_a_1742770_f0004_oc.jpg" alt="blog-image">                        </div><!-- end col-lg-6 -->                                            </div><!-- end card-image-box -->                    <p class="card-text">n the mid-2010s previous iterations of ERPs were loosely coupled solutions. Therefore, Gartner coined a new term of postmodern ERPs that were seen as more agile and outward-facing (Guay “Postmodern Erp Strategies and Considerations for Midmarket It Leaders”). A postmodern ERP is described as a technology strategy that “automates and links administrative and operational business capabilities (such as finance, HR, purchasing, manufacturing and distribution) with appropriate levels of integration that balance the benefits of vendor-delivered integration against business flexibility and agility” (Gartner). In this sense, a postmodern ERP is a more federated, loosely coupled ERP environment with all or most of its functionality sourced as cloud services or business process outsourcers (Guay “Postmodern Erp Strategies and Considerations for Midmarket It Leaders”).                        According to Guay “State of North Carolina Jloc on It”, ERPs have gone through four major phases since the 1980s: (1) best-of-breed between the 1980s and 1990s; (2) monolithic ERPs between the 1990s and 2000s; (3) postmodern ERPs in the 2010s; and (4) a yet unnamed fourth phase that will occur in the 2020s.</p>',

It is relatively easy to create a social media profile such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn. However, it is incredibly important to have a “home base” from which all your social accounts can link back to. As a matter of fact: VeriSign found that 84% of surveyed customers said they believed a business with a website is more credible than one with only a social media page.</p><p class="card-text">It was also found that over 40% of businesses in 2016 did not have a website.
                Thus, merely having a website could put you a step ahead of your competition.

                <p class="card-text">Here are twenty-two of the top benefits of having a website for your small business, along with some ideas on how to get the most out of it:</p>
                <br>
                <h3>1. Look Professional</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="card-text">
                Rather than just being the “corner shop” down the street, having a website (especially a well made one) gives the impression that you are serious, and ready to do business with all kinds of customers. It lends to the credibility mentioned in the survey result above

                <h3>2. Become An Information Resource</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="card-text">
                If your business is in something of a niche industry, having a website is an excellent opportunity to build your reputation as an authority in your field. Create a blog section on your site with informative articles that take advantage of your experience. Potential customers doing web searches on common problems related to your industry will be more likely to find you – and after they read your blog articles, they’ll see how helpful you can be for them. According to one survey, 61% of consumers reported a blog influenced their decision to make a purchase. Even if those who read these blog posts don’t become customers right away, you’ve spread the name of your business without spending a dime on traditional advertising.

Whenever possible, mention in your blog posts your services and a description. For example, if you are a mechanic and your blogs include multiple mentions of “affordable car checkups,” anyone searching that phrase has a higher likelihood of discovering your website.
